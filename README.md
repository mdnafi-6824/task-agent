# COIT12204 Assessment 3: Task Agent

A single LangChain based agent embedded in a small task manager API. The agent
can classify a task's priority, suggest a due date, or write a weekly summary.
It calls tools to read real task data, returns structured JSON, tracks its own
state, and falls back to simple rules when the language model fails. A small
glass style dashboard at `/` shows the tasks, runs the agent, and streams the
state, history and log live.

## Project layout

```

  evaluate.py       Runs the evaluation cases against the real model, writes evaluation/
  seed_tasks.py     Rewrites data/tasks.json with dates relative to today
data/tasks.json     Sample tasks (run scripts/seed_tasks.py to refresh the dates)
data/agent_state.json  Persisted agent state (created on first run)

```

## Setup

Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env               # then put your API key in .env (see below)
```

`.env` values:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `openai` | `openai` or `anthropic`. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (none) | Needed when the provider is openai. Tests never use it. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Any OpenAI chat model with tool calling. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | (none) | Needed when the provider is anthropic. |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Any Claude model with tool calling. |
| `PROMPT_VERSION` | `v3` | `v1`, `v2` or `v3`. See `app/prompts.py`. |
| `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` | `3` | Tool calling rounds before the agent forces an answer. |
| `MAX_INPUT_CHARS` | `500` | Free text longer than this is rejected with 400. |
| `LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `30` | Per call timeout for the model. |
| `HISTORY_LIMIT` | `50` | Entries kept in the state history. |
| `TASKS_FILE`, `STATE_FILE`, `LOG_FILE` | `data/tasks.json`, `data/agent_state.json`, `logs/agent.log` | Where things are stored. |

**Windows PowerShell note:** if `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` fails with a
"running scripts is disabled" error, run this once per terminal window before
activating:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

## Run the API

```bash
python -m scripts.seed_tasks        # optional: fresh sample dates
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ for the dashboard, or http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for
the Swagger UI.

Example calls:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/agent/classify_priority -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"task_id": 5}'
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/agent/suggest_due_date  -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"task_id": 6}'
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/agent/weekly_summary    -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"days_ahead": 7}'
curl localhost:8000/api/agent/state
curl localhost:8000/api/agent/history
```

| Endpoint | Method | Body | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | | Dashboard |
| `/api/agent/classify_priority` | POST | `{task_id}` or `{title, description}` | Priority (low/medium/high) with reasoning and confidence |
| `/api/agent/suggest_due_date` | POST | `{task_id}` | ISO due date suggestion |
| `/api/agent/weekly_summary` | POST | `{days_ahead}` (1 to 30, default 7) | Plain English summary of what is due |
| `/api/agent/state` | GET | | Current AgentState snapshot |
| `/api/agent/history` | GET | `?limit=20` | Recent runs and tool calls |
| `/api/agent/logs` | GET | `?lines=60` | Tail of `logs/agent.log` |
| `/api/agent/state/reset` | POST | | Clear the state |
| `/api/tasks`, `/api/tasks/{id}` | GET/POST | | Plain task CRUD for demos |
| `/health` | GET | | Liveness and current config |

Every agent response has the same shape: `result` (the structured
`AgentResult`), `fallback_used`, `tools_called`, `warnings` (output guardrail
corrections), `prompt_version` and a `state` snapshot. Errors come back as
`{"error", "detail", "request_id"}` with 400 (guardrail rejected the input),
404 (unknown task), 422 (validation) or 500.

## Run the tests

```bash
pytest            # 64 tests, under a second, no network
pytest -v         # one line per test
```

The tests never call a real model. `tests/conftest.py` monkeypatches
`app.agent.get_llm` so the agent receives a `FakeChatModel` that replays
scripted `AIMessage`s (tool requests, JSON answers, prose, or an exception).
`TestClient` drives the FastAPI app with the same fake behind it.

## Run the evaluation

```bash
python -m scripts.evaluate --versions v1 v2 v3 --repeats 2
```

This runs 10 fixed cases against the real model for each prompt version and
writes `evaluation/results_<version>_<timestamp>.json` plus a summary table in
`evaluation/summary.md`. It is roughly 40 to 80 model calls per prompt
version. The results from my own runs are kept in `evaluation/` as evidence
for the report.

There is no authentication on any endpoint and `/api/agent/logs` returns the
server log, so this is meant for local use only.

## How a run works

1. The endpoint validates the body (Pydantic) and checks the task exists.
2. `TaskAgent.run()` builds a `HumanMessage` for the action and invokes the
   LCEL chain `ChatPromptTemplate | llm.bind_tools(TOOLS)`, where `llm` is
   `ChatAnthropic` or `ChatOpenAI` depending on `LLM_PROVIDER`.
3. If the model returns tool calls, each tool is executed with `tool.invoke`,
   the result is appended as a `ToolMessage`, and the chain runs again (at
   most `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` times).
4. The final text is parsed with `PydanticOutputParser` into `AgentResult`.
   If that fails the model is asked once more for JSON only.
5. Output guardrails correct or flag problems (wrong action, past due date,
   missing fields).
6. If anything raised, a rule based fallback produces an `AgentResult` instead.
7. `AgentState.record_run()` updates the counters and history, logs every
   transition, and saves to `data/agent_state.json`.
